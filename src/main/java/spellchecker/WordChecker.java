 * Implement your word checker here.  A word checker has two responsibilities:
 * given a word list, answer the questions "Is the word 'x' in the wordlist?"
 * and "What are some suggestions for the misspelled word 'x'?"
 *
 * spellchecker.WordChecker uses a class called WordList that I haven't provided the source
 * code for.  WordList has only one method that you'll ever need to call:
 *
 *     public boolean lookup(String word)
 *
 * which returns true if the given word is in the WordList and false if not.
